# Programming Basics

Some core programming concepts every data scientist should know are:

[1. Algorithms](#algorithms)</br>
[2. Data Types](#data-types)</br>
3. Data Structures
4. Loops
5. Functions
6. Database

Let's begin!

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions and rules given to a computer program to execute. These algorithms are executed from the moment you start your computer system, open an application or even shutting down your computer, everything is an algorithm.

Our lives are also revolving around algorithms. Our daily routine is an algorithm, the nature is in algorithm and even something as small as baking a cake is a set of instructions.

Let's take a look at an example to understand algorithms in computer:

    Start

    1. Go forward 
    2. Go left
    3. Pick up the glass
    4. Go right
    5. Go back

    End

The above algorithm has 5 defined steps before it is finished. These 5 steps or instructions are given to the computer to execute serially. That means that step 1 would be executed first, then step 2, and so on. Instruction number 5 cannot be executed right after instruction 1 because the algorithm follows a serial pattern, unless instructed to do so otherwise.

Everything in this digital world is based on algorithms and we use them in our daily lives without even thinking about it, because you just read this document from top to bottom, which is also an algorithm!

## Data Types

A data type is used to store, interpret and handle data and it's values.

A number and a character are two different types of data but have their own value in the data world.

Data can be of different types, for example photos, text files, videos, documents are all examples of different types of data.

Data types in programming world are simple and unique. Some of the most common data types are:

### 1. Integer

Integer is used to represent whole numbers in programming world. Some of the integers are: 1, 2, 3... 

Integer data type is used when the user wants to store and use the data as a whole number.

For example: Price of an item.

### 2. Character

The character data type is used to store and use a set of characters. A single character such as `A` or `z` can be stored in the character data type.

### 3. String

Strings are a group of characters which make a word or a sentence. It can include numbers, special characters and symbols as well. An example of string data type is `Hello, World!`
