# Python Basics

Python programming language is one of the most popular programming languages in the world mainly due it's simple and easy to understand syntax. Python can be downloaded from [their website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) onto your computer system. `.py` or `.ipynb` are the extensions for python files.

## Python Syntax

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

This line will generate the following output for you: "Hello, World".

```python
a = 5
```

This line will assign value `5` to the variable `a`. The `=` operator is used to assign a value to a variable or constant.

```python
if a < 5
print("a is less than 5")
```

The above lines will check if the value assigned to variable a is less than 5, then show the given output.

```python
else a > 5
print("a is greater than 5")
```

The above lines will check if the value assigned to variable a is greater than 5, then show the given output.

```python
#I am using comments to hide this line of code
```

The above line will comment out any line of code present in your program. It means that which ever line is commented out, it will not be executed.

```python
else if a == 5
print("a is equal to 5")
```

The `==` operator checks if the assigned value is exactly equal to the given value, then the given output is displayed.

Indentation in python plays a massive role for it's syntax. It allows the compiler to detect the blocks of code which needed to be executed

## Setting Up Google Colab

Google Colab is an online compiler for your python code. It is famous worldwide due to it's no configuration setup, ease of file sharing and execution time.

Google Colab can be accessed through [their website](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). All of it's documentation and usability is already present on this page. This tool is specially build for machine learning and data science projects. All you need to do is to log in to your Google account, and you will be able to access their popular platform for free.
