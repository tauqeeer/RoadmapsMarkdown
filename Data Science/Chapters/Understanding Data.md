## Understanding Data

### Structured Data

Structured data is the form of data that has an effective model and format. One of the best examples to understand structured data is a database as it includes all the entities and their relationships needed to understand that data.

The same data format would be followed for every entry in that database. It makes it easier to track and change data accordingly. It is organized into rows and columns.

Semi-structured data is half structured data in which some of the data would be in a structured format while the rest of the data would be in a random pattern.

Think of semi-structured data as the middle ground between structured and unstructured data. Imagi
